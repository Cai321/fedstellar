{{ super() }}

<br>
<p>Fedstellar is a modular, adaptable and extensible framework for creating centralized and decentralized architectures using Federated Learning. Also, the framework enables the creation of a standard approach for developing, deploying, and managing federated learning applications.</p>
<p>The framework enables developers to create distributed applications that use federated learning algorithms to improve user experience, security, and privacy. It provides features for managing data, managing models, and managing federated learning processes. It also provides a comprehensive set of
    tools to help developers monitor and analyze the performance of their applications.</p>
<p>Fedstellar is developed by <a href="https://enriquetomasmb.com/">Enrique Tomás Martínez Beltrán</a> in collaboration with the <a href="https://um.es/en">University of Murcia</a>, <a href="https://www.armasuisse.ch/">Armasuisse</a> and <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/">University of Zurich (UZH)</a>.</p>
